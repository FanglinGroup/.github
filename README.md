# Welcome to Fanglin Research Group
## AI-Guided Multi-Scale and Multi-Physics Simulations of Catalysis and Material Science

The overarching goal of our research at UMass Lowell is to advance the knowledge of electrified interfacial phenomena via building data-driven multi-scale and multi-physics computational models.
A special focus is placed on field-enhanced chemistry, electrocatalysis, plasma catalysis, and microwave catalysis.
Dr. Fanglin Che has received the prestigious DOE Early Career in Catalysis Science at Basic Energy Science Division in 2023.
And her group is also currently funded by National Science Foundation, Army, and Office of Navy Research.
If you are interested in our group open positions, please send an email to Dr. Fanglin Che, fanglin_che@uml.edu
